# Image-classification-of-cancer-cells-using-Histopathological-Images
The main idea of this project is to classify the Histopathological images of cancer cells into 2 main classes Malignant and Benign
Step-1: Collect the data set from Break His-400x Magnified images of cancer cells Histopathological Images and preprocess them ie.scaling ,Resizing...etc as given in the code
Step-2:Import the necessary librariesand  Load the data set into the project using the location of the data set in your local device and perform preprocessind, trainingand validiation splitting
Step-3 Build the CNN model using the layers from keras which are importe fron tensor flow Frame work
Step-4 Train the model with the predifiend epochs and proceed to testing 
Step-5 Plot the corresponding Graphs of accuracy to know the testing and validation accuraccy.
